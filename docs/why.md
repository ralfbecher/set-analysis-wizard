The [Set Analysis Wizard](http://www.qlikblog.at/1384/set-analysis-wizard-qlikview/) - which can be used for QlikView and Qlik Sense - is one of the most successful solutions I have written in the recent years. It is used thousands of times every months.

The reason to start his project is easy to explain:

* Having something with closed source, seems to be wrong these days
* I want to get rid of many, many eMails like the following:

	* "Can you please open source this solutions, we want to build our own wizard ..."
	* "We need to be able to use the Set Analysis wizard offline"
	* "Can you please help us to create something like the Set Analysis Wizard as an extension for Qlik Sense?"
