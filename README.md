## About this project

This project has the following goals in mind:

* [X] Open source the code for the [existing Set Analysis Wizard](http://tools.qlikblog.at/SetAnalysisWizard/)
* [ ] Create a BNF parser to parse existing Set Analysis statements
* [ ] Create a visualization extension for Qlik Sense, covering the existing functionality + implement tight integration leveraging the Client APIs of Qlik Sense
* [ ] Invite other developers to develop this solution together with me

If you are interested in getting this solution or in participating, just follow this project here on GitHub, and you'll read more about my summer 2015 project very soon.

## Why

The [Set Analysis Wizard](http://www.qlikblog.at/1384/set-analysis-wizard-qlikview/) - which can be used for QlikView and Qlik Sense - is one of the most successful solutions I have written in the recent years. It is used thousands of times every months.

The reason to start his project is easy to explain:

* 
Having something with closed source, seems to be wrong these days
* 
I want to get rid of many, many eMails like the following:

  - "Can you please open source this solutions, we want to build our own wizard ..."
  - "We need to be able to use the Set Analysis wizard offline"
  - "Can you please help us to create something like the Set Analysis Wizard as an extension for Qlik Sense?"

## About the solution

Working on a project like this is (for me) not about re-producing existing knowledge, but about experimenting and learning new approaches and technologies, that's the reason of the following set up for the solution.

### The Set Analysis parser

The backbone of the new Set Analysis wizard will be a parser which is able to parse and therefore "decode" existing Set Analysis statements into something which is easy to understand and modify.

The goal is that you can paste in the following expression

```
Sum({$<Customer=P({1<Product={'Shoe'}>}Customer)>}Sales)
```

and you'll get back the following description

> Returns the Sum of Sales for the current selection, but only for those customers that have bought the product "Shoe".

Then you should be able to use the wizard to easily modify the Set Analysis statement.

I have chosen to use [Jison](http://zaach.github.io/jison/) to parse existing Set Analysis statements.

If you have a look into the online documentation of Qlik Sense, you'll find the [BNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form) syntax for sets there:

```
// Added entry point
definition ::= aggr_type ( set_expression field_expression )

// From the online help
// http://help.qlik.com/sense/2.0/en-US/online/Subsystems/Hub/Content/ChartFunctions/SetAnalysis/syntax-for-sets.htm
set_expression ::= { set_entity { set_operator set_entity } }
set_entity ::= set_identifier [ set_modifier ]
set_identifier ::= 1 | $ | $N | $_N | bookmark_id | bookmark_name
set_operator ::= + | - | * | /
set_modifier ::= < field_selection {, field_selection } >
field_selection ::= field_name [ = | += | ¬–= | *= | /= ] element_set_expression
element_set_expression ::= element_set { set_operator element_set }
element_set ::= [ field_name ] | { element_list } | element_function
element_list ::= element { , element }
element_function ::= ( P | E ) ( [ set_expression ] [ field_name ] )
element ::= field_value | " search_mask "
```
