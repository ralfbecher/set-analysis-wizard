## About this project

This project has the following goals in mind:

* [X] Open source the code for the [existing Set Analysis Wizard](http://tools.qlikblog.at/SetAnalysisWizard/)
* [ ] Create a visualization extension for Qlik Sense, covering the existing functionality + implement tight integration leveraging the Client APIs of Qlik Sense
* [ ] Invite other developers to develop this extension together with me

If you are interested in getting this solution or in participating, just follow this project here on GitHub, and you'll read more about my summer 2015 project very soon.

## Why

The [Set Analysis Wizard](http://www.qlikblog.at/1384/set-analysis-wizard-qlikview/) - which can be used for QlikView and Qlik Sense - is one of the most successful solutions I have written in the recent years. It is used thousands of times every months.

The reason to start his project is easy to explain:

* 
Having something with closed source, seems to be wrong these days
* 
I want to get rid of many, many eMails like the following:

  - "Can you please open source this solutions, we want to build our own wizard ..."
  - "We need to be able to use the Set Analysis wizard offline"
  - "Can you please help us to create something like the Set Analysis Wizard as an extension for Qlik Sense?"
